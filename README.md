# TypeSpace

TypeSpace is a typing game that was created from scratch, as a team.  The game challenges typing abilities in a fun way by placing the player in outer space as a spaceship trying to manage the hostile environment of constant asteroids flying at the ship.  The player is given three lives and every time an asteroid crosses across the screen, a life is lost.  In order to shoot down an asteroid with the spaceships lasers, the player must type out the randomly spawned assigned word the specific asteroid has to destroy the asteroid before it reaches the ship.  Another thing to look out for is extra lives that fly across the screen.  These cannot cause you to lose a life but, if you type out the life, you can gain another life to help you survive the asteroids you have coming your way.

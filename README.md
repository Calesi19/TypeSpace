# Possible Sources
These are links to sites that could be useful to help us learn more about what to do and how to do it, but there's no guaruntee that they'll help.

[Stack Overflow - Best Way to Make a Django Game](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51857043/best-way-to-make-a-multiplayer-turn-by-turn-online-game-with-python-back-end)
* Basically someone only knows Python, they want to make a turn-based game to play with their friend. The top response recommended learnign ReactJS, but said if that wasn't an option due to time then it can be done without knowing ReactJS.
[Tutorial: Real-Time Web Game with Django Channels and React](https://codyparker.com/django-channels-with-react/)
* This was the resource given for the above Stack Overflow request, it looks decent. It assumes we have experience working with Django, but not so much React.
